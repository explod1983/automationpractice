# Practice test selenium by O.Sergyeyev

## Goal:
Create a set of automated tests using this website: [http://automationpractice.com/index.php] as the product under test.

Select the scenarios you think are most important for this application (a mix of business and user needs) and implement them.

## Solution:
Due to lack of time and plenty of business use-cases, I have decided to develop one E2E use case.
Use Case:
 - A potential user opens the home page, selects a product he\she liked, sets the needed amount by pressing the according button, and goes through the registration and payment process with several checks during all these actions.

## How to run:

 1. Clone the project
 2. `cd automationpractice`
 3. `python -m venv venv`
 4. If Windows `venv\Scripts\activate`
 5. `pip install -r requiremnts.txt`
 6. `python tests.py`

## NOTE:
There are plenty of moments that need to be improved in the Test Framework, test environmnet and the test case itself, but I couldn't afford to spend a lot of time solving all of them.
